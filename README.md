# floptran-iv
Original and updated versions of FLOPTRAN-IV, a simplified-BASIC compiler for Commodore PETs and other CBM machines.
FLOPTRAN-IV relies on floating point routines in ROM not a run-time package.  The original version, published in Byte, October 1980, runs only on the original ROM (BASIC1) PETs.  It is necessary to update a number of ROM entry points and some low-memory locations to work on different targets.
